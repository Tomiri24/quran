# quran
A light, basic and ad-free Quran reader for Android.
This application has been developed with the sole purpose to display and make reading Quran (one of the basics of Islam) available to as many people as possible.
I chose to develop this app for Android first because:
1. It is one of the most widespread mobile phone operating systems on the whole Earth
2. It is easy to work with with the integration of Kotlin and Java (this app is developed on Kotlin (cuz who's using Java in 2024??)
3. An app can be easily expanded to work with other Android-based devices like an AndroidTV...

You are allowed to see the insides of this app, but not to copy it. Inside it there are the licenses for all of the assets used (i think)
the main app's license is located here, and not inside it.

This app is to be considered open-sourced content. But i couldn't upload the main files and folder for fear to ruin everything.
to see the insides of it, just download the apk file and rename it to something that finishes with .zip, then unpack it.
